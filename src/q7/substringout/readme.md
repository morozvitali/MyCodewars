Write a function that takes two string parameters 
search_text and full_text and returns the number 
of times the search_text is found within the full_text.

Overlap is not permitted: "aaa" contains 1 instance of "aa", not 2.
search_text will never be empty.
Examples:
full_text = "aa_bb_cc_dd_bb_e", search_text = "bb"
--> should return 2 since "bb" shows up twice


full_text = "aaabbbcccc", search_text = "bbb"
--> should return 1
